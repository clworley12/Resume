    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
    <hr/>
    <h2>Travel</h2>
    <p>I love to travel and have been to more than 30 countries and all seven continents.  I love to see the diversity of landscapes, animals and cultures.  I have also travelled to all of the states in the USA, aided by my husband's love of flying. We use our Cirrus SR22 Turbo routinely to explore new areas.</p>
    <h2>Hiking</h2>
    <p>Though I do not get to do it often, I love to hike.  It is exhilerating to see what is around the next corner.  Through hiking, you are able to experience new locations very intimately and appreciate the small details and changes occurring subtly as you progress along the trail.
    <h2>Baking</h2>
    <p>As a stress eater, I naturally gravitated to satisfying my base desires by creating whatever suits my cravings at the moment.</p>
    <h2>Airplane Building</h2>
    <p>My husband and I are in the process of building an RV 14 in one of our warehouses.  We look forward to flying it once we are done since it is quite the sportscar of a plane and can even do some aerobatics.</p>
    <h2>Gardening</h2>
    <p>Though I was born with a brown thumb, I found that daylilies were difficult to kill.  For many years while I had land, I hybridized daylilies.</p>
